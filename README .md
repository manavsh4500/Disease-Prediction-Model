##  General Info

Initally disease dataset is taken as input and data preprocessing is applied to the input datasets, it leads to reduce the unwanted information for the further analysis. Random forest Classifier Algorithm is used which gives us the disease assosciated with each symptoms. The performance of the model is told using F1 score and recall.
